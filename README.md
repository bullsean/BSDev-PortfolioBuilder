# Portfolio Builder

### Team Name: 
BS Developers (Bullock Seyham)

### App Name: 
Portfolio Builder (Portfolio Content Management System (PCMS))

### Problem/User Story: 
Professionals/freelancers who don't have an affordable/quick way to build an online portfolio, PCMS allows users to choose and create a clean, beautiful personal portfolio that is able to be shared immediately with others.

### Steps to use the app:

1. Sign up for an account. All you'll need is an email and password.

3. Once all of your information has been submitted, you're ready to check out what you look like online! Click any of the template buttons at the bottom to give it a try. Once you decide on the one for you, you can simply copy and paste the link to share with potential employers or others. If you don't like sharing the https address as-is, you can use a goo.gl shortner or tiny.url link instead.

4. Any time you need to update your portfolio, log back in to update your forms. It's the simple. The links you've shared will automatically be updated with the new information.
